# VeriDevOps Patterns - FAGOR examples

This repository contains Java implementation of Requirement as Code concept, where requirements are provided by Fagor Electrodom√©stico, S. Coop.

## Why Java?

No specific reason. The core idea of this implementation is to capture the object oriented nature of requirements in the FAGOR case. Any other language supporting object oriented programming would be just as fine.

However, it is worth noting that c++/C# would perhaps be a better choice here since requirements are written for Windows and win32 API would come in handy.
